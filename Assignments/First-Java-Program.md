## Course Assignments

1. **Even or Odd Checker**

   - **Objective**: Write a program to print whether a number is even or odd, taking input from the user.
   - **Topics Covered**: Conditionals, user input.

2. **Greeting Message**

   - **Objective**: Take a name as input and print a greeting message for that particular name.
   - **Topics Covered**: User input, string manipulation.

3. **Simple Interest Calculator**

   - **Objective**: Write a program to input principal, time, and rate (P, T, R) from the user and calculate the Simple Interest using the formula `SI = (P * T * R) / 100`.
   - **Topics Covered**: Arithmetic operators, user input.

4. **Basic Calculator**

   - **Objective**: Take two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input, and calculate the result using `if` conditions.
   - **Topics Covered**: Conditionals, arithmetic operators, user input.

5. **Find the Largest of Two Numbers**

   - **Objective**: Input two numbers and print the largest one.
   - **Topics Covered**: Conditionals, user input.

6. **Currency Converter (INR to USD)**

   - **Objective**: Take an amount in INR as input and convert it to USD using a fixed conversion rate.
   - **Topics Covered**: Arithmetic operations, user input.

7. **Fibonacci Series**

   - **Objective**: Write a program to calculate and print the Fibonacci series up to `n` numbers, where `n` is provided by the user.
   - **Topics Covered**: Loops, user input.

8. **Palindrome Checker**

   - **Objective**: Determine whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward).
   - **Topics Covered**: String manipulation, conditionals.

9. **Armstrong Number Finder**
   - **Objective**: Write a program to find Armstrong numbers between two given numbers.
   - **Topics Covered**: Loops, conditionals, user input, number manipulation.

## Extra Assignments

1. **Simple Calculator**

   - **Topics Covered**: User input, arithmetic operators, conditionals.

2. **Odd or Even Checker**

   - **Objective**: Write a program that checks whether a number is odd or even.
   - **Topics Covered**: Modulo operator, conditionals.

3. **Sum of Natural Numbers**

   - **Objective**: Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, where `n` is provided by the user.
   - **Topics Covered**: Loops (`for`), user input.
